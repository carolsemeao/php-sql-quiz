# RETROSPECTION

- I set 1 goal for this quiz project. To have a working quiz in the end. I always set daily tasks that I wanted done. Most of the time I got them done by the end of the day.

# THE GOOD
- I learnt so much during this project and I'm so proud of myself that I have a functioning quiz with a functioning report page
- I'm also proud of myself, that I pulled through this project. I like Frontend-Development more than Backend and I wasn't really interested in PHP / mySQL but I still pulled through.

# THE BAD
- The errors that I sometimes got. Most of the times, it was very frustrating to fix things, because I didn't even know what the problem was

# THE UGLY
- Stated in obstacles.md
