# MY OBSTACLES

- To be honest to connect the database to PHP was pretty difficult. I was struggling a lot. That's why I decided to become a "Stepper" in my course so I go through the most important things step-by-step. This was the first project, that I really stuggled since the beginning.

- Sometimes the styling became a bit difficult as well. I was very frustrated about the radio inputs because they didn't want to coorporate the way I wanted to and my "NEXT" button keeps moving and I don't know how to fix this problem

- I really wanted to make the Choices as buttons themselves. It worked out styling-wise, but when it got to the report page, it didn't count my correct answers. Since I didn't have enough time to keep trying more, I had to scratch that idea and keep working with the radio inputs.
